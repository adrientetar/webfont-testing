                novel by Camus) with friends after dropping out of college at
                the age of 19. He gave up his job at Salford docks shortly after
                to devote his full energies to the Fall, and has continued to do
                so ever since. Smith married Chicagoan guitarist (and Fall band
                member, 1983?89, 1994?96) Brix Smith on 19 July 1983, though
                they divorced in 1989. He has since remarried twice; his second
                wife was Saffron Prior who used to work for The Fall's fan club.
                He married his present wife, Eleni (sometimes called Elenor or
                Elena) Poulou, in 2001, and she joined The Fall in September
                2002. When British DJ and Fall champion John Peel died in 2004,
                Smith made a notorious appearance on the BBC's Newsnight
                show.[3] Regarded by many as a bewildering performance, Smith
                has made his appreciation for Peel clear in several subsequent
                interviews. Nevertheless, the two only met a handful of times.
                Though he broke his hip while promoting the album The Real New
                Fall LP (Formerly Country on the Click) in 2004, Smith refused
                to cancel an upcoming American tour, instead choosing to perform
                in a wheelchair. Unfortunately the pain and medication caused a
                number of dates to be cancelled. In January 2005, The Fall were
                the subject of The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of
                Mark E. Smith, a BBC Four television documentary. The following
                August, Smith received the "Contribution to Music" award at the
                Diesel-U-Music Awards. Smith's autobiography, Renegade: The
                Gospel According to Mark E. Smith, recorded with
                Manchester-based writer Austin Collings, was published by Viking
                Books in April 2008. The latest studio album by The Fall, Ersatz
                GB, was released on 14 November 2011. 01234567890 </p>

                so ever since. Smith married Chicagoan guitarist (and Fall band
                member, 1983?89, 1994?96) Brix Smith on 19 July 1983, though
                they divorced in 1989. He has since remarried twice; his second
                wife was Saffron Prior who used to work for The Fall's fan club.
                He married his present wife, Eleni (sometimes called Elenor or
                Elena) Poulou, in 2001, and she joined The Fall in September
                2002. When British DJ and Fall champion John Peel died in 2004,
                Smith made a notorious appearance on the BBC's Newsnight
                show.[3] Regarded by many as a bewildering performance, Smith
                has made his appreciation for Peel clear in several subsequent
                interviews. Nevertheless, the two only met a handful of times.
                Though he broke his hip while promoting the album The Real New
                Fall LP (Formerly Country on the Click) in 2004, Smith refused
                to cancel an upcoming American tour, instead choosing to perform
                in a wheelchair. Unfortunately the pain and medication caused a
                number of dates to be cancelled. In January 2005, The Fall were
                the subject of The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of
                Mark E. Smith, a BBC Four television documentary. The following
                August, Smith received the "Contribution to Music" award at the
                Diesel-U-Music Awards. Smith's autobiography, Renegade: The
                Gospel According to Mark E. Smith, recorded with
                Manchester-based writer Austin Collings, was published by Viking
                Books in April 2008. The latest studio album by The Fall, Ersatz
                GB, was released on 14 November 2011 01234567890 </p>
